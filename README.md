# Placement Preparation Platform

This is a simple scaffold for a placement preparation website. It includes sections for:

- Aptitude practice (mock quiz placeholder)
- Coding practice links (tiles for easy/medium/hard)
- Mock tests (placeholder)
- Interview tips and checklists

How to run:

Open `index.html` in your browser.

Next steps you might want me to do:
- Add a backend or storage for persistent quizzes and user progress
- Integrate an online code editor (e.g., embedding Replit or an iframe to judge code)
- Add more aptitude questions and a proper quiz UI instead of prompt()
- Wire up timed mock tests and scoring

Tell me which features to build next and I will implement them.
